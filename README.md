# PackyðŸ“¦

Some info about our cool project.



## Features

- EB-AFIT Pallet Loading Algorithm
- REST API
- Documentation `(!)`

## Usage

*Packy* hasn't installation version, just script launch. And supports **only x32** Python 3.

All `.dll` and `.so` already precompiled, but you may do it [yourself](#compile-library).

### Windows

```
python packy.py
```

Linux now is not much tested, but you may try

### Linux

```
python3 packy.py
```

## Compile library

**TL;DR:**

### Windows

Just use *Microsoft Visual Studio 2019* with C/C++ Development Extension, project already in this repository. 

### Linux

Didn't tested, but try compile `main.cpp` file from *VS2019* project with `g++` with flags, maybe something like `-Wl`, but remember about [name mangling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Name_mangling). Sorry, idk `Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯`

```bash
 # something like that
g++ -shared -Wl,-soname,3d_packer -o 3d_packer.so -fPIC main.c
```

## Stack of technology

#### Algorithm: `C/C++`

#### Back-end: `Python 3, Flask, Jinja 2`

#### Front-end: `JS (D3, jQuery)`
